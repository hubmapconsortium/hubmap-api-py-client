Help on class ExternalClient in hubmap_api_py_client:

hubmap_api_py_client.Client = class ExternalClient(builtins.object)
 |  hubmap_api_py_client.Client(base_url)
 |  
 |  The Client provides methods for querying different entity types.
 |  The methods return ResultSets which can be combined with set operators,
 |  and then finally evaluated to get the actual data.
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, base_url)
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |  
 |  __repr__(self)
 |      Return repr(self).
